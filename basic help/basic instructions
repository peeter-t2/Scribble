* Start-up of Okular.

- Needs a KDE environment, instructions are on homepage. Needs additional environments, like libpoppler-qt4.
Exhaustive list should be on homepage.

-To run, I have added 

1) In "~/.bashrc" added:
export KDEDIRS=$KDEDIRS:$HOME/install:$(kde4-config --prefix); kbuildsycoca4

2) In "~/.profile" added (which is my separate installation folder) Note. Running two different versions of Okular
is so far unsuccessful.:

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$HOME/install/bin:$PATH"
fi

3) In /etc/environment

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/where/install/poppler/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/where/install/poppler/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PAT

To run Okular, terminal must be running for bash commands to be used.



* Compiling Okular

I used simple c++ commands

kasutaja@kasutaja-laptop:~/Downloads/okulardev/okular$ cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/install/ .. && make
kasutaja@kasutaja-laptop:~/Downloads/okulardev/okular/build$ make install

To replace changes in current version, only "make install" part is needed.
