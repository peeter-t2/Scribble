The idea is to retrieve the exact text selection used while tagging at a later point on click.

For this:

1) The coordinates need to be saved in a similar fashion as highlight_annotation coordinates are.

2) Text selection needs to be retrieved on one click based on those coordinates.

3) There has to be something to click on. A later step.


This would allow text selections to be stored in a similar manner as highlights, while at the same 
time they might be tagged as well. Tags can be stored similarly to highlight or any other annotation
comments.


This would allow later tags to be a) searchable, and b) separately manipulable. There could be a global switch
for tag button visibility.


I would place the tag buttons somewhere on the side, but that is a later GUI issue.
