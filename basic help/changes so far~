UI/pageview.cpp

Created a new menu item called tagTheText, with message Tag the Text.

On the basis of copyTextSelection(), made a function called copyPropsSelection(),
that is exactly the same but works on selectedProps().

selectedProps() is a function based on selectedText(), however the purpose of it is to retrieve the
coordinates of selected items rather than text itself. 


pagesWithTextSelection seems to be made with 
void PageView::selectionStart( const QPoint & pos, const QColor & color, bool /*aboveAll*/ )
and
void PageView::updateSelection( const QPoint & pos )

That is it should include also the coordinates of the boxes (one for each line), which is what
should be retrieved.





core/annotations.h

New class called ThematicTagAnnotation , based entirely on HighlightAnnotation.

New public enumeration of subtype in class Annotation (OKULAR_EXPORT) called AThematicTag = 15,

new functions within the same Annotation class 
	void setThematicTags( const QString &thematictags );
	QString thematicTags() const;
